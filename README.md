# MTProto Proxy CentOS 7 Auto Installer
A very small script to install MTProtoProxy On CentOS 7
## Why this installer?
* Generate random secret
* Automatically configure firewall
* Create a service to run it on background and start up
* Choose between Official Proxy and Python Proxy
* Easy to setup
* Revoke and add secrets after install
## Official Or Python Proxy?
Use python if:
1. Your server's CPU has one core.
2. Your server is low-end.
3. You are serving a small group of people. (Like family or small company)
4. You want to disable to access users without random padding. [See here](#secure-only)
5. You also have another application running on your server. (Openvpn, shadowsocks, nginx or ...)

Otherwise, use official proxy.
#### Performance?
Python proxy says it can serve about 4000 concurrent connections with 1 CPU core (~2.5 GHz) and 1024MB RAM.

Official proxy can serve about 10000 to 16000 connections per core.
## Python Script
### Install
On your server run
```
curl -o MTProtoProxyInstall.sh -L https://git.io/vhgUt && bash MTProtoProxyInstall.sh
```
Wait until the setup finishes, you should be given the links. (using `systemctl status mtprotoproxy -l` will display said links as well)

To update, uninstall, change port, revoke secret or... the proxy, run this script again.
#### Secure Only
You can enable random padding with adding a `dd` at the beginning of secret in Telegram client. [Read More](#random-padding) If you enable secure mode, server drops the connections that are not using the random padding.
#### Managing The Proxy
##### Service
Use `systemctl start mtprotoproxy` to start, `systemctl stop mtprotoproxy` to stop and `systemctl status mtprotoproxy -l` to see logs of script.
##### Config
To manually config, proxy edit config.py in /opt/mtprotoproxy to change the config; Then restart the server using `systemctl restart mtprotoproxy` or just run script again.
###### Installing Proxy's Master Branch
Should you want to test the stuff that are not available in the stable branch of [mtprotoproxy](https://github.com/alexbers/mtprotoproxy), pass `-m` as argument to script to install master branch.
```
curl -o MTProtoProxyInstall.sh -L https://git.io/vhgUt && bash MTProtoProxyInstall.sh -m
```
## Official Script
### Install
On your server run
```
curl -o MTProtoProxyOfficialInstall.sh -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HirbodBehnam/MTProtoProxyCentOSInstall/master/MTProtoProxyOfficialInstall.sh && bash MTProtoProxyOfficialInstall.sh
```
and wait until the setup finishes and you will see the links after install.
#### Workers
Each worker can handle more than 10000 connections on a modern CPU. Connections will be split between workers. Do not spawn workers more than your CPUs thread count.
#### Managing The Proxy
##### Service
Use `systemctl start MTProxy` to start, `systemctl stop MTProxy` to stop and `systemctl status MTProxy -l` to see logs of script.
##### Config
The service file is saved in `/etc/systemd/system/MTProxy.service`. You can edit it manually. There is also a file named `mtconfig.conf` at `/opt/MTProxy/objs/bin` that is created by script. Itâ€™s used in loading proxy configs by script. *You must not delete this file* ,however, you can edit it.
## Other Information
### Firewall
Setup will try to configure the proxy on public zone. However you can manually enter these rules in case of any error or whatever. Just rerun the script and choose `Generate Firewalld Rules` and script will generate and apply firewall rules.
### Random Padding
Due to some ISPs detecting MTProxy by packet sizes, random padding is added to packets if such mode is enabled.
It's only enabled for clients which request it.
Add dd prefix to secret (cafe...babe => ddcafe...babe) to enable this mode on client side.
### Server
You can use any VPS or Dedicated Server. If you want a cheap and low-end server, I personally recommend to buy one at [Virmach](https://virmach.com/); They also accept cryptos!

If you live in Iran and you want to pay with IRR you can buy one at [Tikweb](https://tikweb.ir/) or [ParsHost](https://pars.host/).
